@article{felsenstein1973maximumlikelihood,
  abstract = {When we try to reconstruct the evolutionary tree of a group of organisms by
examining a series of characters, we are not applying strict logical deduction but
are making a guess in the presence of uncertainty. It is therefore appropriate to
think of the problem in terms of statistical inference. This approach was first sug-
gested by Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza [1-4]. The data collected by systematists
and by students of molecular evolution are mostly for discrete characters, such as
the presence or absence of a morphological structure or the amino acid sequence
of a protein. But much data are also collected for quantitative characters, such as
gene frequencies and measurements on morphological traits. In this paper, I will
confine my attention to quantitative characters. This is the case originally con-
sidered by Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza. They proposed that the estimation of
evolutionary trees be carried out by the method of maximum likelihood. However,
they found troublesome singularities in what they believed to be the likelihood
surface [3, 4]. They were forced to fall back on ad hoc approaches which did not
have an explicit statistical justification (their "method of minimum evolution" and
"additive tree model"; see also [5]). Malyutov et al. [6] have described another
ad hoc approach.
In this paper, I will use the basic model proposed by Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza.
I will show that if we are less ambitious than they were, and redefine the problem
so as not to attempt to estimate as many quantities, we can construct a likelihood
function which does not have any such singularities. It is then possible to construct
computer programs which obtain maximum-likelihood estimates of the evolutionary
tree when the data are in the form of quantitative measurements.

@article{revell2009phylogenetic,
  abstract = {Many evolutionary processes can lead to a change in the correlation between continuous characters over time or on different branches of a phylogenetic tree. Shifts in genetic or functional constraint, in the selective regime, or in some combination thereof can influence both the evolution of continuous traits and their relation to each other. These changes can often be mapped on a phylogenetic tree to examine their influence on multivariate phenotypic diversification. We propose a new likelihood method to fit multiple evolutionary rate matrices (also called evolutionary variance–covariance matrices) to species data for two or more continuous characters and a phylogeny. The evolutionary rate matrix is a matrix containing the evolutionary rates for individual characters on its diagonal, and the covariances between characters (of which the evolutionary correlations are a function) elsewhere. To illustrate our approach, we apply the method to an empirical dataset consisting of two features of feeding morphology sampled from 28 centrarchid fish species, as well as to data generated via phylogenetic numerical simulations. We find that the method has appropriate type I error, power, and parameter estimation. The approach presented herein is the first to allow for the explicit testing of how and when the evolutionary covariances between characters have changed in the history of a group.},

@article{pourahmadi1999joint,
  abstract = {We provide unconstrained parameterisation for and model a covariance using covariates. The Cholesky decomposition of the inverse of a covariance matrix is used to associate a unique unit lower triangular and a unique diagonal matrix with each covariance matrix. The entries of the lower triangular and the log of the diagonal matrix are unconstrained and have meaning as regression coefficients and prediction variances when regressing a measurement on its predecessors. An extended generalised linear model is introduced for joint modelling of the vectors of predictors for the mean and covariance subsuming the joint modelling strategy for mean and variance heterogeneity, Gabriel's antedependence models, Dempster's covariance selection models and the class of graphical models. The likelihood function and maximum likelihood estimators of the covariance and the mean parameters are studied when the observations are normally distributed. Applications to modelling nonstationary dependence structures and multivariate data are discussed and illustrated using real data. A graphical method, similar to that based on the correlogram in time series, is developed and used to identify parametric models for nonstationary covariances.},

@article{huelsenbeck2003detecting,
  abstract = {Abstract.— The importance of accommodating the phylogenetic history of a group when performing a comparative analysis is now widely recognized. The typical approaches either assume the tree is known without error, or they base inferences on a collection of well-supported trees or on a collection of trees generated under a stochastic model of cladogenesis. However, these approaches do not adequately account for the uncertainty of phylogenetic trees in a comparative analysis, especially when data relevant to the phylogeny of a group are available. Here, we develop a method for performing comparative analyses that is based on an extension of Felsenstein's independent contrasts method. Uncertainties in the phylogeny, branch lengths, and other parameters are accommodated by averaging over all possible trees, weighting each by the probability that the tree is correct. We do this in a Bayesian framework and use Markov chain Monte Carlo to perform the high-dimensional summations and integrations required by the analysis. We illustrate the method using comparative characters sampled from Anolis lizards.},
